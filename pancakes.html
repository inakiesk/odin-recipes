    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These delicious breakfast cakes are said to resemble those from a famous
         pancake house. Serve topped with butter</p>
    


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 and 1/4 cups of buttermilk</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup vegetable oil </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup white sugar </li>
        <li> 1 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li> 1 dash salt </li>
        <li> 1 egg</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon lemon juice </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon butter, or as needed </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract in a bowl;
             stir in the sugar. Whisk in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, 
             and salt, combining the batter with just a few strokes to moisten.
              Leave the lumps.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg and lemon juice together; 
            gently stir into the batter. Refrigerate the batter for at least 
            30 minutes, up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and grease with the butter. 
            Pour 1/3 cup of batter per pancake into the skillet and cook
             until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. 
            Flip with spatula and brown the other side, about 2 more minutes.</li>

    </ol>
